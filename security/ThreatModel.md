Subject: Threat Model- Banking Application

    Upon the release of (SOME BANK)'s new mobile application, our team should look at the threat model 
for said application, thus ensuring the Users privacy and secruity remains as safe as possible.
The User, anyone using the banking application, should be provided with a trustworthy and convenient product, one that not only makes there busy life easier but also protects the information they might not want to share. The goal of setting up these migiations would be to prevent the User's Adversaries, criminals who want the Users banking information (i.e. account number, access to funds in the account etc.) from being able to log in to the banking applicationa as the User.
One main attack surface that I'd like to bring up is the users phone itself. Should the User's phone be stolen we wouldn't want the application to be easily accessed by the adversary. A mitigation for this would be for the user to select an 8 digit security key that they would enter after loginng in with their password. Thus making it harder for the person who stole their pone to have access to the application.
